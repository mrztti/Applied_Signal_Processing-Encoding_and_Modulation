# Applied Signal Processing Project 1
In many practical scenarios including digital communications and image restoration, we measure a desired signal that has been passed through a linear system (which we can equivalently regard as a linear filter). In order to simplify further processing it is often desirable to restore the original signal as much as possible. When using a linear filter, this operation is often called inverse filtering, deconvolution or equalization. In this project we are going to design a data transmission system over an acoustic channel, transferring text messages between two units via sound in the air. The project addresses the following problems:

1. Signal encoding/decoding from the bit stream to symbols
2. Conversion to an analogue coding/decoding technique; orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
3. Transmission channel equalization
4. Modulation/demodulation of the signal to/from a frequency band suited for acoustic transmission
5. Interpolation/decimation to convert the signal between different sampling rates in the system

**The project is split into two parts A and B**

## Part A : Baseband communication

## Part B: Interpolation, Modulation, Demodulation and Decimation
